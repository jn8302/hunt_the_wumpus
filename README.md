# hunt_the_wumpus

We're making a text-based map-based Hunt the Wumpus game in APCS!

To do:

- [ ] Should lose right after you miss
- [ ] Finally, make everything invisible!
    - [ ] Reveal everything when you lose from lack of grenades


- [X] Implement `nextTo()`  throughout program
- [X] Make a method that makes wumpus and player wrap
    - [X] Implement `wrap()`
- [X] Make limited grenades (if you run out of grenades you lose)
